      Science Department in the University. I have been teaching for 20 years. I
      will be asking you to take your interview for the admission. You can ask any
      questions about the course and University at the end, but as it is a masters
      program, we also expect you to have your own research about the university
      and course. In fact, that shows us how motivated and dedicated you are.
